## Description:		Script to update any Extension Attribute values based on scripts located
##			in a specified directory, by using the Casper Suite API

## Casper Suite API assignments
##
## Hardcode the API username/password and JSS URL below, or, assign Casper Suite script parameters
## for each item to have them passed down to the script at execution time

apiUser=""		## Assign Parameter 4 if using Casper Suite script parameter
apiPass=""		## Assign Parameter 5 if using Casper Suite script parameter
jssURL=""		## (Optional - see below) Assign Parameter 6 if using Casper Suite script parameter
			## Special note: The script will use the following priority order to assign the JSS URL:
			## 1)	If the JSS URL is hardcoded into the script it will be used first
			## 2)	If the JSS URL variable is empty in the script and a Casper Suite parameter is
			##		assigned for parameter 6, it will be used
			## 3)	If the JSS URL variable is empty in the script and no Casper Suite parameter has
			##		been assigned, the script will attempt to get the JSS URL from the client's
			##		com.jamfsoftware.jamf.plist file.
			## 4)	If the JSS URL variable is empty in the script, there is no Casper Suite parameter
			##		assigned, and the script cannot get the JSS URL from the client, the script will
			##		exit with an error since any upload of the resulting xml will be impossible.
			##
			## If you assign the JSS URL, either hardcoded or by script parameter, leave off the
			## trailing slash from the string. Ex: "https://my.jssserver.com:8443"

## Set the following variable to "yes" if its required to have the Mac check to see if
## it is on your internal network.
## Explanation : This will be required in cases where you have a Limited Access JSS.
## Although the JSS Connection test will pass, an API upload attempt will fail because Tomcat
## is required, which is disabled on the external WebApp instance.
## If your JSS is openly accessible from the outside, you can leave this setting blank.
##
## Note: You must also specify either an internal http address or hostname to check for
## internal connection verification in the next variable.

internal_check_req="yes"

## If internal_check_req is set to yes, enter an internal address (hostname or http URL) the
## script can use for checking internal connectivity.
## Some examples of what you can enter are full http://www. style URLs (http://www.school.org),
## or a base hostname (school.org). Be sure what you enter is accurate or it may result in
## false failures, which will cause the script to exit.

## You may also assign parameter 7 to the script in Casper Suite for the internal_address variable.

internal_address=""		## Assign Parameter 7 if using Casper Suite script parameter

## OPTIONAL: Set the following to:
## a) path to the base directory that contains the extension attribute scripts
## b) path to the final xml file to be used in the API PUT upload.
## You may also leave these as is.
## Be sure to drop your EA script files into the basePath directory at the top level
basePath="/Library/Application Support/JAMF/extension_attributes"
xmlDir="/Library/Application Support/JAMF/extension_attributes_xml"
