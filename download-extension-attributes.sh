## Description:		Script to download all Extension Attribute scripts from a
##			Casper Suite version 9.x JSS. For more detailed information,
##			run the script in Terminal with the -h flag

## The following section contains the only variables that should be manually edited in
## the script. They can also be assigned to the script as Casper Suite parameters.
## Read the descriptions for more info.

## If you choose to hardcode API information into the script, set the API Username and
## API Password here. Note: The API account only needs 'read' privileges to pull
## Extension Attribute scripts

apiUser=""		## Set the API Username here if you want it hardcoded
apiPass=""		## Set the API Password here if you want it hardcoded
jssURL=""		## Set the JSS URL here if you want it hardcoded

## Set the script downloads folder path here.
## Default path is within the JAMF directory in "extension_attributes"
scriptDownloadDir="/Library/Application Support/JAMF/extension_attributes"

SYNOPSIS
	sudo script.sh -a "api_user" -p "api_password" -s "server"
	or
	sudo jamf runScript -script "script.sh" -path "/path/to/" -p1 "api_user" -p2 "api_password" -p3 "server"

COMPATIBILITY:
	Casper Suite version 9.x
	
OPTIONS:
	-h	Show this usage screen
	-a	API account username
	-p	API account password
	-s	JSS Server address [optional]

DESCRIPTION:
	This script can be used to download a copy of all Extension Attribute scripts
	located on the Casper Suite server specified in the server option.
	The Casper Suite server URL is optional. If not specified at run time, the script
	will attempt to obtain the JSS address from the client's settings.
	
	The script can be run in two primary ways.
	1. Calling the script directly on the shell
	
	Example:
	sudo "$0" -a "api_username" -p "api_password" -s "https://jss.server.com:8443"
	
	2. Using the jamf binary
	
	Example:
	sudo jamf runScript -script "$script" -path "$directory" -p1 "api_username" -p2 "api_password" -p3 "https://jss.server.com:8443"
	
	You may also use the script directly in a JSS policy, specifying the API username,
	API password and (optionally) the JSS URL in parameters 4 through 6, respectively.

NOTES:
	It is recommended to enclose the API username, API password and JSS URL in double quotes
	to protect the script against any special characters or spaces in the strings.
